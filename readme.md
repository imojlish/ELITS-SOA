1. Inventory Demand Forecasting Model
Objective: Predict future inventory needs to optimize stock levels and minimize stockouts and overstock.
Model Type: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
Architecture:
Input Layer: Features include historical sales data, promotional events, seasonality, economic indicators, etc.
LSTM Layers: Capture temporal dependencies in the data.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers to output the forecasted demand.
Output Layer: Predicted inventory demand for future time periods.


Dataset
1. Synthetic Inventory Dataset
Attributes:
date: Date of the record.
product_id: Unique identifier for each product.
sales: Number of units sold.
promotions: Binary flag indicating if there was a promotion.
economic_index: An index representing economic conditions.
seasonality_index: An index representing seasonal effects.
stock_level: Current stock level.
reorder_point: Reorder point for the product.
lead_time: Lead time for restocking.


Example
Scenario: A user wants to predict the inventory demand for the next month for product P001 using the model and dataset.
Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, normalize features, and create time series sequences.
Model Training: Train the LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
Forecasting: Use the trained model to predict the future inventory demand.
